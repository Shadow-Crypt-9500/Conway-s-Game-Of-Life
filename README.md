🌱 Conway's Game of Life 🧬



Conway’s Game of Life is a zero-player game devised by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a cellular automaton where cells on a grid evolve through generations based on simple rules, creating fascinating and often unexpected patterns.

This implementation allows you to:

✅ Visualize how simple rules lead to complex behaviors

✅ Experiment with patterns like Gliders and Pulsars

✅ Customize grid size and speed

🌟 Features

✨ Interactive Grid – Create and modify cell patterns easily
⏯️ Start, Pause & Reset – Control the simulation with one click
⚡ Customizable Speed – Change how fast generations evolve
📐 Resizable Grid – Play on grids of different sizes
📚 Predefined Patterns – Explore famous patterns like Gliders, Pulsars, etc.
📱 Responsive Design – Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile

🚀 How It Works

The game runs on a grid where each cell can be alive or dead. At every generation, the following rules are applied:

✅ Underpopulation: A live cell with fewer than 2 neighbors dies.

✅ Survival: A live cell with 2 or 3 neighbors survives.

✅ Overpopulation: A live cell with more than 3 neighbors dies.

✅ Reproduction: A dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive.

These simple rules create intricate and mesmerizing patterns over time.
