**Conway's Game of Life ðŸ§¬**

Conwayâ€™s Game of Life is a zero-player game devised by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a cellular automaton where cells on a grid evolve through generations based on simple rules, creating fascinating patterns and behaviors.

This implementation allows you to visualize the evolution of cells in a grid, explore different starting configurations, and observe how complex patterns emerge from simple rules.

**ðŸŒŸ Features**
  1. Interactive grid to create and modify cell patterns

  2. Start, pause, and reset the simulation

  3. Customizable grid size and speed

  4. Predefined patterns like Gliders, Pulsars, and more

  5. Clean and responsive UI

ðŸš€ **How It Works**

The game runs on a grid where each cell can be alive or dead.

At each step (generation), the following rules are applied to every cell:

 âœ… Underpopulation: A live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies.

 âœ… Survival: A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives.

 âœ… Overpopulation: A live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies.

 âœ… Reproduction: A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.

These simple rules can lead to very complex and beautiful patterns over time.
